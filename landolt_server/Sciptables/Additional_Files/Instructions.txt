If I make a change, it will track.

When I go to stage, commit, push, it will only do that file. When pulled, it will grab the changed file automatically

do a "git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories" every time I start work.


STAGE AND COMMIT FIRST

"git add -u" to stage

"git add -A" to add new files to track

"git commit -am "(what has changed)"

"git push origin main" when finished.
